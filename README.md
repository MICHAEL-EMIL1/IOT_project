Smart Home
## Project Description
IOT or internet of things is an upcoming technology that allows us to control hardware devices through the internet. Here we propose to use IOT to control home appliances, thus automating modern homes through the internet. This system uses loads to demonstrate as house lighting, a fan and more. Our user-friendly interface allows a user to easily control these home appliances through the internet.
